								<h4>About the Project</h4>
									To showcase my growth in data visualization, I decided to revisit my first dashboard project and give it a revamp using the new skills I've acquired 
									in data storytelling, design, and color theory.</p>
									
									<p>While the data remains the same, I've created new and improved charts that address the limitations of the originals, such as enhanced clarity, deeper insights, 
									and strategic use of color to highlight the key takeaways. I'm excited to share this journey and demonstrate how my skills have grown!</p>
									
														
								<h4>Introduction</h4>
									Bellabeat is a high-tech health and wellness company which offers a variety of wellness products focusing on women's health. Their wearable devices which connect 
									to the Bellabeat app track activity, sleep, and stress. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women 
									with knowledge about their own health and habits.</p>
									
									
									<p>Below you will find the new dashboard which contains 3 pages to navigate for insights on Market Trends, Activity, Sleep and Calories
									with tooltips to extract more information.</p>

								<h4>Business Task</h4>
									<p>In this case study I play the role of a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat. I have been asked to help Bellabeat stakeholders gain insight 
									into the smart device market, how their product fits in and how they can gear their marketing strategy to get more sales​.</p>
																											
								<h4>Stakeholders</h4>
								        <b>Urška Sršen:</b> Bellabeat’s cofounder, Chief Creative Officer and former artist
									<br><b>Sando Mur:</b> Mathematician and Bellabeat’s cofounder; key member of the Bellabeat executive team
									<br><b>Bellabeat marketing analytics team:</b> collect, analyze, and report data wich helps guide Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.</p>
									
                   
								<h4>About the Data</h4>
									The Kaggle FitBit Fitness Tracker Data by MÖBIUS was used for this project. I was originally crowd sourced from 30 eligible Fitbit users between March 12 and June 12 2016 by: Furberg, Robert; 
              								    Brinton, Julia; Keating, Michael; Ortiz, Alexa.​ It contains information about FitBit user activity, steps, sleep and expended calories.</p>
               								 
									<p>I sourced Google Trends Search Term Data for step, sleep and activity tracking to uncover trends in the smart device market.</p>
									
									 
								<h4>Tools Used</h4>
									<p>Google Trends (Data Collection)
									<br>Excel (Data Cleaning) 
									<br>SQL BigQuery (Data Exploration & Filtering)
									<br>Tableau (Visualization)
									<br>PowerPoint (Presentation)</p>
								
									<h4>Insights & Chart Changes</h4>
									The Google Trends Search Term Data shows that over time people have become less interested in activity tracking and much more interested in step and sleep tracking.</p>
                 							
									<p>The original chart is very busy, difficult to read, and the axis text is cut off. The new chart highlights the most important information using text and color.
									Which let's the viewer quickly see the trends over time.</p>
									<p><img src="images/Bellabeat trends.png" alt="" width="750" height="450"></p>
               								   
									<p>58% of the Fitbit participants included a moderate number of steps (5,000 - 10,000 steps/day), but only 21% reached the CDC an AHA recommended 10,000 steps per day.
									The remaining 21% were sedentary taking less than 5,000 steps per day.</p>									
									
									<p>The original chart contains unecessary elemants such as user id numbers, grid lines and too many colors which make it difficult to read. The new chart highlights
									the fact that only a small percentage of participants took the recommended steps.</p>
									<p><img src="images/Bellabeat user steps.png" alt="" width="750" height="400"></p>
									
									<p>The original chart contains too many colors and doesn't highlight the most important information. In the new chart one can quickly see that
									the participants took the most steps on Saturday and the least on Sunday. It also includes more context by showing the number of users and 
									the amount of steps they took on average.</p>
									<p><img src="images/Bellabeat steps.png" alt="" width="750" height="300"></p>

									<p>This chart wasn't included in the original dashboards. It clearly shows that participants were sedentary the majority of the time.</p>
									<p><img src="images/Bellabeat activity.png" alt="" width="595" height="292"></p>
										
									<p><p>The original chart contains too many colors and doesn't highlight the information adequately. In the new chart one can see that Sunday was the day that 
									participants had the most trouble falling asleep at 51 minutes. It also includes average time to fall asleep and average hours of sleep.</p>
									<p><img src="images/Bellabeat sleep.png" alt="" width="750" height="300"></p>

									<p>This new chart which shows that more activity leads to more calories burned.</p>

								<h4>Recommendations</h4>
									<br>Marketing should be geared towards step and sleep tracking as these have been gaining popularity in recent years.</br>
									<br>Since Bellabeat utilizes digital marketing extensively, leverage social media campaigns to inspire and motivate followers by sharing content that 
									showcases the benefits of step and sleep tracking:</br>
									<ul class="sudo"><li>Sunday Recharge: Post empowering messages on Sunday mornings. The data shows this is the day that users take the fewest steps, take longer to fall asleep, 
									and sleep the most.</li>
									<li>Daily Step Challenge: Focus on step tracking initiatives by helping followers set achievable step goals through the day to motivate them to stay active.</li>
									<li>Sleep Smarter: Post sleep hygiene tips and facts to show how sleep tracking can help followers gain insights into their sleep patterns so they can get deeper, 
									more restorative sleep.</li></ul>
									
																		
								<h4>Data Limitations</h4>
								<ul class="sudo"><li>The FitBit data is not ROCCC, it is bad quality data (outdated, not from the original source, and incomplete). 
									<li>Of the 33 participants only 24 participated in the sleep data and 8 in the weight data​ collection. All 33 did participate in the daily activity data collection.
									<li>The data is possibly biased due to the small sample size.​
									<li>It does not include gender, age, ethnicity. This limits how tailored the recommendations can be.</li>
									<li>More complete data with a much larger sample set is needed in order to come to more accurate conclusion​s.</li></ul></p>

								<p><h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
									I designed a visually appealing Dashboard that aligns with Bellabeat's brand identity while prioritizing clarity and information. keeping in mind Sršen's 
									artistic background and Bellabeat's youthful energy. This project was part of the The Google Analytics Capstone Project which includes the Tableau dashboard 
									and the original Powerpoint presentation below.</p>
