								<h4>Project Details:</h4>
									<p>I tracked my vegetable gardening progress between April 2021 and June 2023. The purpose of this project was to take my garbled notes 
                 							 and make sense of them to answer a few questions:</p> 
							<ol class="sudo"><li>When should I start each plant?</li>
									<li>Which plants are worth growing again and which are not?</li>
                						  <li>Which sowing and growing methods do I use the most? So, I can stock up on materials for next year.</li>
									<li>Where do I need to concentrate my efforts in terms of pest control?</li></ol></p>

									<h4>About the Data</h4>
									<p>The data originally consisted of handwritten notes in my garden journal written between April 2021 and June 2023. When I realized it was very time consuming to search 
										through my notes, I transfered all the information to an excel sheet. The data contains 3 tables consists of 23 fields and 53 records in xlsx format. 
										And consists of plant information, growing methods, pests and productivity. I collected information about grocery store prices per ld.
										
																				
									<h4>Tools Used</h4>
					<ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>Excel (Data Collecting & Cleaning)</li> 
									<li>SQL BigQuery (Data Exploration)</li> 
									<li>Tableau (Visualization)</li></ul><p></p>
									
									<h4>Insights:</h4>
									<ul class="sudo"><li>There is no correlation between productivity and taste. Some of the less tasty varieties are â€˜pretty productive'.</li>
                 							 <li>Most of the 'not productive' varieties are really tasty.</li>
                							  <li>Some of the quicker growing varieties are more expensive at the grocery store.</li>
									<li>Some of the slower growing varieties are cheaper.</li></p></ul>
               								  <p><img src="images/garden price.png" alt="" width="496" height="464">
									
                 							 <li>Most of my plants were not affected by pests.</li>
									<li>I start most of my plants by directly seeding into the ground and in seed trays.</li>
									<li>I grow mostly in fabric grow bags and plastic pots.</li></p>

								<h4>Recommendations:</h4>
									With the rising cost of food and questionable growing practices it makes sense to grow as much of my own food as possible.
									<ul class="sudo"><li>Herbs are a must grow at $57 per lb. and under 60 days to harvest.</li>
									<li>Carrots and squash may not be worth the time and effort, since they are relatively inexpensive and 
									  take a long time to grow.</li>
									<li>The productive but not so great tasting varieties aren't worth growing since I won't eat them.</li>
									<li>It may be worth growing some tastier varieties in larger quantities to make up for their low productivity.</li>
									<li>Since direct seeding doesn't require equipment, I'll only need to stock up on seed trays.</li>
                							  <li>I'll need to stock up on fabric grow bags and plastic pots depending on how many plants I decide to grow next year.</li>
                							  <li>I will have to keep an eye out for white flies and aphids since they are the most prevalent of the peats in my garden.</li></ul>
            
                						<p><h4>Data Limitations:</h4>
									I'm a new gardener so many of my plantings were an experiment just to see if they would grow. 
                							  <ul class="sudo"><li>This collection of data is by no means complete, I often forgot to write things down as they happened.</li>
									<li>Unintended casualties, i.e. dead plants were not included in this data.</li>
									<li>At the beginning of my gardening adventures i didn't know any better and made many many mistakes. </li></p></ul>
																		
								<p><h4>Data Source:</h4>
									Data was collected by me in a garden journal over the course of 2 years.</p>
