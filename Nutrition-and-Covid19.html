								<h4>Introduction</h4>
									Exploring and visualizing the COVID-19 Healthy Diet Dataset in order to determine how nutritional choices affect Covid 19
									outcomes worldwide. And how healthcare providers can help guide patient's nutritional choices to achieve better
									outcomes if infected with covid 19. This was the Capstone Project for the UC Davis Data Visualization with Tableau Specialization.</p> 
									
								<b>Two personas were created for this project:</b>
								        <p>The stakeholder is a hospital administrator who is trying to come up with a plan to help reduce Covid 19 
									severity and negative outcomes. She will present the findings to the audience.</p>
									<p>Audience/ Subject-matter experts: The final presentation is intended for the heads of the Medical, Nursing and Dietary departments at the hospital. 
									This will dictate what the members of each department will tell their patients when it comes to diet and Covid 19.</p>

								<h4>About the Data</h4>
									<p>The Kaggle COVID-19 Healthy Diet Dataset by Maria Ren includes information about global COVID-19 cases rates, world population obesity and undernourished rates and food data. The
									Covid data is from the week of 02/06/2021. The author calculated fat quantity, energy intake (kcal), food supply quantity (kg), and protein (as percentage of total intake) for different categories of 
									food. The data is contained in 4 tables consisting of 32 fields in csv format. 171 records contain country nutrition data but only 164 records contain country Covid data.</p>
									
									<h4>Tools Used</h4>
									<p>Data cleaning was conducted in Microsoft Excel and exploration/visualization in Tableau. I created a dashboard story to give a summary of the analysis 
									I performed.</p>
									
								<h4>Business Questions</h4>
									<ol class="sudo"><li>How do nutritional choices affect Covid 19 outcomes?</li>
									<li>How can healthcare providers help guide patient's nutritional choices to achieve better outcomes if infected with covid 19?</li></ol>
									
																	
								<h4>Insights</h4>
									<p>there is a positive correlation between Obesity Rates and Death Rates. Countries with higher Obesity Rates have overall higher death rates. </p>
									
									<p><img src="images/covid obesity rate.png" alt="" width="731" height="309"></p>
									
									<p>Countries with higher Animal Products/Fats consumption have more deaths overall than countries with
									higher Vegetal Products/Fats consumption.</p>
									
									<p>Although Seafood is an Animal Product, lower death rates were noted in countries with the highest consumption.</p>
									
									<p><img src="images/covid seafood.png" alt="" width="533" height="628"></p>
									
									<p>Countries with higher Grain, Pulse and Spice consumption had lower Death Rates.</p>
									
									<p>Countries with higher Alcohol and Sugar consumption had higher death rates.</p>
									
									<p><img src="images/covid sweets.png" alt="" width="683" height="557"></p>
									
								<h4>Recommendations</h4>
									The medical staff should advise patients to:
									<li>Eat plenty of vegetables/fruits, grains, pulses and seafood.</li>
									<li>Use spices freely and often when cooking.</li>
									<li>Limit animal products (except seafood), alcohol and sweetners.</li>
									<li>Replace animal fats with vegetable oils.</li></ul>
									<p>The medical staff should also help obese patients create a plan so they can achieve a healthy weight.</p>
									
								<h4>Data Limitations</h4>
									Note that these are general guidelines:
									<ul class="sudo"><li>The data groups all foods in their respective categories.</li>
									<li>It does not distinguish for instance between 'healthy' oils such as olive and avocado and 'inflammatory' oils such as cottonseed and partially hydrogenated oils.</li>
									<li>It does not distinguish between proccessed food and food in it's whole form.</li>
									<li>It does not distinguish between organic, grass fed, pasture raised etc. and conventionally grown food.</li>
