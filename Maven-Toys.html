								<h4>Introduction</h4>
									Maven Toys is a fictitious chain of small toy stores; they currently have 50 stores spanning 29 cities throughout Mexico. I was hired as a BI consultant 
									to analyze patterns and trends in their sales and inventory data in order to create an expansion plan for 2024.</p>

									<p><b>To view the full 2 page interactive Tableau Dashboard click <a href=https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jacqueline.alsina/viz/MavenToys_17043171360960/Dashlocation style="color: blue" target="_blank" </a>Here</a></b></p>
									
									<h4>Dataset</h4>
									Sales & inventory data for the fictitious toy stores, includes information about products, stores, daily sales transactions, and current inventory levels 
									at each location collected between January 1, 2022, and September 30, 2023. The data contains 4 tables consisting of 16 fields and 829,262 records in csv format. 
									
									<p>Mexican airport passenger traffic data was sourced to determine which airports would be best suited for expansion. Wikipedia 'List of 
									the busiest airports in Mexico' includes the 50 busiest airports by passenger traffic between 2020-2022. For the purposes of this analysis only 
									data from 2021 and 2022 was used.</p>
									
									<h4>Tools Used</h4>
									<p>Data cleaning was conducted in Microsoft Excel, exploration in SQL using BigQuery and visualization in Tableau. I created database schema to better understand relationships between the 4 tables.</p>

									<h4>Business Questions</h4>
									<ol class="sudo"><li>Where should Maven Toys expand to?</li>
											<li>How many stores should they open?</li>
											<li>Which products will perform best at the new location(s)?</li></ol>
									
															
								<h4>Insights:</h4>
							<ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>1. Where should Maven Toys expand to?</li></ul>
							<ul class="sudo"><li>Mavenâ€™s top 2 stores are located at Mexico City and Guadalajara International Airports, which account for 7% of total sales. 
									And overall airport locations do better than the other types of locations.</li>
									<p></p><img src="images/Maven top stores.png" alt="" width="795" height="282"><p></p>
									<li>Cancun and Tijuana international airports are top choices for expansion in 2024.</li></ul>
									<p></p><img src="images/Maven airports.png" alt="" width="718" height="274"><p></p></ul>
							
							<ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>2. How many stores should they open?</li></ul>
							<ul class="sudo"><li>On average 2.6 stores have been opened per year. Opening 2 stores would be in line with this trend.</li></ul>
									<p></p><img src="images/Maven store openings.png" alt="" width="700" height="273"><p></p>
							
							<ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>3. Which products will perform best at the new location(s)?</li></ul>
							<ul class="sudo"><li>These products with above average sales are the top performers at existing airport stores.</li>
								<p></p><img src="images/Maven top toys.png" alt="" width="440" height="412"><p></p>
								<li>Lego Bricks, the top product has been skyrocketing in sales. While Colorbuds has been plummeting in the same period.</li>
								<p></p><img src="images/Maven product performance.png" alt="" width="440" height="420"><p></p>
								<li>The new stores can expect to see $273K (Cancun) and $111K (Tijuana) in sales based on an average .0.9% conversion rate of airport passengers to product sales.</li></ul>
								<p></p><img src="images/Maven new airports.png" alt="" width="428" height="333"><p></p>
									
								<h4>Recommendations:</h4>
									<ul class="sudo"><li><b>Open two Stores:</b> Cancun and Tijuana International Airports are both fast-growing and busy airports, based on passenger traffic. 
									These would work well since existing airport stores are top performers. We expect sales at the Cancun and Tijuana stores to be $273K and $111K, respectively.</li>
									<li><b>Display Top Products:</b> Since space is at a premium at airport stores only stock products with above average sales within each category 
										(based on top performers from existing airport stores):</li></ul>
					<ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>Toys - Lego Bricks, Action Figure, Animal Figures</li>
									<li>Arts & Crafts - Majic Sand, Kids Makeup Kit</li>
									<li>Electronics - Colorbuds, Gamer Headphones</li>
									<li>Games - Glass Marbles, Rubik's Cube, Deck of Cards</li>
									<li>Sports & Outdoors - Nerf gun, Splash Balls, Dart Gun</li></ul>
							<p></p><ul class="sudo"><li><b>Increase Sales:</b> Colorbuds has been steadily decreasing in sales over time. This could be due to a variety of factors which would 
										need further investigation. Meanwhile, Colorbuds should be displayed prominently in stores to see if sales improve.</li>
									<li><b>Increase Profitability:</b> Lego Bricks is the top seller but has among the lowest profit ratio of all the products. Since it's becoming a 
										very popular product consider raising the price, avoiding markdowns and working with suppliers to reduce product costs.</li></ul></p>
									
									
								<h4>Data Limitations:</h4>
							<ul class="sudo"><li>The Maven Toys data is not comprehensive as it only covers one full year (2022) and partial data for 2023 (up to September). </li>
									<li>Airport passenger traffic data is only available for 2022.</li>
									<li>To better analyze current trends, obtaining updated Maven Toys data beyond September 2023 and acquiring 2023 airport passenger 
										traffic data would be necessary. </li></ul>
