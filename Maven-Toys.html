								<h4>Project Details:</h4>
									Maven Toys is a fictitious chain of toy stores; they currently have 50 stores spanning 29 cities throughout Mexico. They hired me as a BI consultant 
									to analyze patterns and trends in their sales and inventory data in order to create an expansion plan for 2024. I also sourced Mexican airport passenger traffic in order to 
									determine which airports were best suited for expansion. Data cleaning was conducted in Excel, 
									exploration in SQL and visualization in Tableau.</p> 
									
									<p><b>To view the full interactive Tableau Dashboard click <a href=https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jacqueline.alsina/viz/MavenToys_17043171360960/Dashlocation style="color: blue" target="_blank" </a>Here</a></b>></p>      
									
									
								<b>This analyis will answer the following important questions:</b>
									<ul class="sudo"><li>Where should Maven Toys expand to?</li>
											<li>How many stores should they open?</li>
											<li>Which products will perform best at the new location(s)?</li></ul>
									
															
								<h4>Insights:</h4>
									<ul class="sudo"><li>Countries with higher Obesity Rates have overall higher death rates.</li>
									<img src="images/obesity rate.png" alt="" width="731" height="309">
									<li>Countries with higher Animal Products/Fats consumption have more deaths overall than countries with
									higher Vegetal Products/Fats consumption.</li>
									<li>Although Seafood is an Animal Product, lower death rates were noted in countries with the highest consumption.</li>
									<img src="images/seafood.png" alt="" width="533" height="628">
									<li>Countries with higher Grain, Pulse and Spice consumption had lower Death Rates.</li>
									<li>Countries with higher Alcohol and Sugar consumption had higher death rates.</li></ul>
									<img src="images/sweets.png" alt="" width="683" height="557">
									
								<h4>Recommendations:</h4>
									<ul class="sudo"><li>Open 2 Stores: Cancun and Tijuana International Airports are both fast growing, and very busy airports based on passenger traffic. 
										These would work well since existing airport stores are top performers.</li>
									<li>Display Top Products: Since space is at a premium at airport stores only stock products with above average sales within each category 
										(based on top performers from existing airport stores):</li>
						<p style="margin-left:10%;"><li>Toys - Lego Bricks, Action Figure, Animal Figures</li>
									<li>Arts & Crafts - Majic Sand, Kids Makeup Kit</li>
									<li>Electronics - Colorbuds, Gamer Headphones</li>
									<li>Games - Glass Marbles, Rubik's Cube, Deck of Cards</li>
									<li>Sports & Outdoors - Nerf gun, Splash Balls, Dart Gun</li>
									<li>Increase Sales: Colorbuds has been steadily decreasing in sales over time. This could be due to a variety of factors which would 
										need further investigation. Meanwhile, Colorbuds should be displayed prominently in stores to see if sales improve.</li>
									<li>Increase Profitability: Lego Bricks is the top seller but has among the lowest profit ratio of all the products. Since it's becoming a 
										very popular product consider raising the price, avoiding markdowns and working with suppliers to reduce product costs.</li></ul>
									
									
								<h4>Data Limitations:</h4>
							<ul class="sudo"><li>The data is only until September 2023.</li>
									<li>It does not distinguish for instance between 'healthy' oils such as olive and avocado and 'inflammatory' oils such as cottonseed and partially hydrogenated oils.</li>
									<li>It does not distinguish between proccessed food and food in it's whole form.</li>
									<li>It does not distinguish between organic, grass fed, pasture raised etc. and conventionally grown food.</li>
